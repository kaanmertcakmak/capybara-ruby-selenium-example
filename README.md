Ruby - Capybara - Selenium Example Framework
 ----------------------

This is a example project that I co-developed when I worked in my previous company.
 I've deleted datas related with login and checkout so tests will probably fail.
 
  #### Requirements
  
  Ruby (2.4.6)
  Bundle
  Rake
  
  After installed above tools, go to the project dir and run "bundle install". Then all of the required libraries will be installed.
  
#### Run Tests

- "bundle exec rake test" command will run tests in production

- "bundle exec rake stage" command will run tests in stage
